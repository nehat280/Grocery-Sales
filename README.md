# Grocery-Sales

In this notebook i have analysed the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores located in Ecuador. The training data includes dates, store and item information, whether that item was being promoted, as well as the unit sales for year 2013 - 2017. Additional files include supplementary information that may be useful in building your models.

Since the  train data set is large , **Memory Optimisation techinques** are used on Train set to reduce the train dataset size.
